This is a chatbot application in development.

Admin should be able to dynamically generate a chatbot.

Step 1

Get chat functionality working without the dinamic forms and hardcoded data.
Look at new.ejs for how the form should work. It is non-dynamic, final product should make a single form appear, and then the rest appears dynamically

Step 2
Once the forms are dynamically generated, then we should generate the bot UI
This includes all the CRUD operations, and making it available on the released platform.
